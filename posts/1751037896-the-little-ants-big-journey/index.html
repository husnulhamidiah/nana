She was very small, but she had big dreams. Every day, she watched the bigger ants carry food and help the queen. &lsquo;I wish I could do something important too!&rsquo; Tilly sighed.</p><p>One day, a big rainstorm flooded the garden. The water started to rise, and all the ants were scared. &lsquo;We need to find a way to save our food!&rsquo; shouted one of the ants. But the flood was too big for the older ants to handle.</p><p>Tilly felt nervous but decided she had to do something. She had an idea! &lsquo;I will bring the food to the big hill!&rsquo; she said. The hill was high, and the ants could place food there to keep it safe from the water. But the path was long and tricky for a tiny ant like Tilly.</p><p>With her little legs moving fast, Tilly carried food piece by piece, dodging puddles and climbing over small rocks. The other ants watched her and cheered, &lsquo;Go Tilly! You can do it!&rsquo; After a long time, Tilly finally reached the hill. She smiled proudly. &lsquo;I did it! I helped the whole garden!&rsquo;</p><p>The rain stopped, and the ants were safe. The queen said, &lsquo;Tilly, you may be small, but you have a big heart. You saved us all!&rsquo; Tilly beamed with happiness. She knew that sometimes, being small didn’t mean you couldn’t do big things.</p></div><p class=single-summary>Even the smallest one can do big things if they try hard.</p></article><div class=single-pagination><hr><div class=flexnowrap><div class=single-pagination-prev><div class=single-pagination-container-prev><div class=single-pagination-text>←</div><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/nana/posts/1751037922-the-little-blue-fish-and-the-lost-shell/>The Little Blue Fish and the Lost Shell</a></div></div></div><div class=single-pagination-next><div class=single-pagination-container-next><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/nana/posts/1751037950-the-brave-little-squirrel/>The Brave Little Squirrel</a></div><div class=single-pagination-text>→</div></div></div></div><hr></div><div class=back-to-top><a href=#top>back to top</a></div></div></main></div><footer></footer></body><script src=/nana/js/theme-switch.js></script><script defer src=/nana/js/copy-code.js></script></html>
