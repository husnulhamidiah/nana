Every day, he wore it when playing in the jungle.
One morning, Leo looked for his hat but could not find it anywhere.
He looked under the trees and behind the bushes.
&lsquo;Where is my hat?
&rsquo; Leo wondered.
Just then, his friend Tilly the Turtle came by.</p><p>Tilly saw Leo looking sad and asked, &lsquo;Leo, what is wrong?
&rsquo; Leo sighed, &lsquo;My hat is missing.
I don’t see it anywhere.
&rsquo; Tilly thought for a moment.
&lsquo;Maybe someone took it by mistake.
&rsquo; she said kindly.
Leo nodded.
He wanted his hat back because it made him feel special.</p><p>Leo and Tilly decided to ask their friends if they saw the hat.
They went to Sam the Squirrel first.
Sam looked surprised.
&lsquo;I didn’t take your hat, Leo,&rsquo; he said.
&lsquo;I found a bright orange hat near the pond this morning.
It might be yours.</p><p>Leo and Tilly went to the pond.
They saw a squirrel hiding behind a bush.
It was Sam, holding something orange.
&lsquo;Is that my hat?
&rsquo; Leo asked gently.
Sam looked sad.
&lsquo;Yes, Leo.
I found it and wanted to keep it because I liked how it looked.</p><p>Leo smiled and said, &lsquo;Thank you for being honest, Sam.
I’m glad you told me the truth.
&rsquo; Sam looked happier.
&lsquo;I will give your hat back, Leo.
&rsquo; Sam handed the hat to Leo, who was very happy.
Leo told Sam, &lsquo;It’s okay to like things, but it’s always better to tell the truth.</p><p>Leo put his hat back on his head and felt warm inside.
He said, &lsquo;Thank you, everyone, for helping me find my hat and for being honest.
Being kind and honest makes our jungle a better place.
&rsquo; Everyone nodded happily.
From that day on, they all knew how important it is to be truthful and kind to friends.</p></div><p class=single-summary>Being honest and kind helps solve problems and makes everyone happy.</p></article><div class=single-pagination><hr><div class=flexnowrap><div class=single-pagination-prev><div class=single-pagination-container-prev><div class=single-pagination-text>←</div><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/nana/posts/1752262679-lina-and-the-lost-snowflake/>Lina and the Lost Snowflake</a></div></div></div><div class=single-pagination-next></div></div><hr></div><div class=back-to-top><a href=#top>back to top</a></div></div></main></div><footer></footer></body><script src=/nana/js/theme-switch.js></script><script defer src=/nana/js/copy-code.js></script></html>
