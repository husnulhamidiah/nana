She loved sitting on her big branch to watch the sunrise.
It was her favorite spot to rest and think.
One day, Luna wanted to show her friend, Sammy the squirrel, her beautiful tree.
But when she went to her big branch, it was gone!
Luna looked all around and felt worried.
&lsquo;Where did my branch go?
&rsquo; she wondered.</p><p>Sammy the squirrel saw Luna upset and asked, &lsquo;What’s wrong, Luna?
&rsquo; Luna explained, &lsquo;My big branch is missing!
I need it to sit and watch the sky.
&rsquo; Sammy thought hard and said, &lsquo;Let’s ask the other animals.
Maybe someone moved it by mistake.
&rsquo; So, Luna and Sammy began to talk to more animals.
They asked a wise old owl, a busy woodpecker, and a kind rabbit.</p><p>Soon, they found out that a playful wind had blown the big branch to a new spot in the tree.
It was resting safe but in a different place.
Luna felt happy but a little sad too.
She said, &lsquo;I thought someone took my branch, but it was just the wind!
&rsquo; Sammy smiled and said, &lsquo;Now we know that sometimes, things move because of nature.
We should share and help each other, even when things change.</p><p>Luna thanked her friends for their help.
She learned that waiting patiently and asking questions can solve problems.
Luna decided to get a new view on her favorite spot.
She sat on her small favorite branch nearby and watched the sky, feeling glad that her big branch was safe, even if it was in a new place.
From then on, Luna enjoyed her home more and shared time with all her friends.</p></div><p class=single-summary>Sometimes, sharing and patience help us find solutions and make everyone happy.</p></article><div class=single-pagination><hr><div class=flexnowrap><div class=single-pagination-prev><div class=single-pagination-container-prev><div class=single-pagination-text>←</div><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/nana/posts/1752264231-the-curious-little-bird-and-the-big-problem/>The Curious Little Bird and the Big Problem</a></div></div></div><div class=single-pagination-next></div></div><hr></div><div class=back-to-top><a href=#top>back to top</a></div></div></main></div><footer></footer></body><script src=/nana/js/theme-switch.js></script><script defer src=/nana/js/copy-code.js></script></html>
