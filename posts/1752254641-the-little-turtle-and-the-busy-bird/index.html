Turtle said, &ldquo;I am slow but steady.
I think I can win!&rdquo;
Bird laughed and said, &ldquo;I am fast but tiny.
Let’s see who wins!&rdquo;
They lined up at the starting line and were ready to race.</p><p>As soon as they started, Bird flapped her wings and zoomed ahead.
Turtle moved slowly but kept going.
After a while, Bird got tired and sat on a branch.
She looked down at Turtle moving peacefully.</p><p>Bird thought, &ldquo;I want to help Turtle.
Maybe we can finish the race together.&rdquo;
She swooped down and said, &ldquo;Turtle, let’s do this side by side.
I will help carry you part of the way.&rdquo;
Turtle agreed and smiled, &ldquo;Thank you, Bird.
That is kind of you.&rdquo;</p><p>Bird gently perched on Turtle’s back, and they moved together.
Slowly but surely, they reached the finish line side by side.
Both friends cheered and felt happy.
They learned that working together is more fun than racing alone.</p></div><p class=single-summary>Helping and sharing can make everyone a winner.</p></article><div class=single-pagination><hr><div class=flexnowrap><div class=single-pagination-prev><div class=single-pagination-container-prev><div class=single-pagination-text>←</div><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/nana/posts/1752254548-timmy-and-the-lost-toy/>Timmy and the Lost Toy</a></div></div></div><div class=single-pagination-next></div></div><hr></div><div class=back-to-top><a href=#top>back to top</a></div></div></main></div><footer></footer></body><script src=/nana/js/theme-switch.js></script><script defer src=/nana/js/copy-code.js></script></html>
