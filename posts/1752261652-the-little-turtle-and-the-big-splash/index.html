He watched the fish dart quickly through the water.
&lsquo;I wish I could swim fast like them,&rsquo; he sighed.
He wanted to be the fastest swimmer in the pond.</p><p>His friends, the Fish, chirped happily.
&lsquo;Come swim with us!
&rsquo; they said.
Little Turtle hesitated.
&lsquo;I don’t think I can do it.
I am too slow,&rsquo; he whispered.</p><p>The Fish encouraged him, &lsquo;It’s okay to try.
Just have fun and do your best.
&rsquo; Little Turtle decided to give it a try.
He took a deep breath and pushed himself into the water.</p><p>At first, he wobbled and splashed.
The other animals watched.
&lsquo;Be brave, Little Turtle!
&rsquo; cheered the frogs.
Little Turtle felt a little scared, but he remembered his friends&rsquo; words.
&lsquo;I can do it if I try,&rsquo; he thought.</p><p>Slowly, Little Turtle started swimming more smoothly.
He splashed and moved his little legs.
He didn’t care if he was the fastest.
He just wanted to enjoy the water and have fun.
His friends cheered him on.</p><p>After a while, Little Turtle felt happy.
He hadn’t won a race, but he learned something special.
Being brave and trying his best made him smile.
He paddled back to his friends, feeling proud and brave.</p><p>That day, Little Turtle learned that having fun is more important than winning.
It’s good to try and do your best.
Being brave can make your day bright and happy.</p></div><p class=single-summary>Trying your best and being brave brings happiness, even if you don’t win.</p></article><div class=single-pagination><hr><div class=flexnowrap><div class=single-pagination-prev><div class=single-pagination-container-prev><div class=single-pagination-text>←</div><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/nana/posts/1752261247-luna-and-the-lost-hat/>Luna and the Lost Hat</a></div></div></div><div class=single-pagination-next><div class=single-pagination-container-next><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/nana/posts/1752262246-leo-the-little-lions-big-problem/>Leo the Little Lion’s Big Problem</a></div><div class=single-pagination-text>→</div></div></div></div><hr></div><div class=back-to-top><a href=#top>back to top</a></div></div></main></div><footer></footer></body><script src=/nana/js/theme-switch.js></script><script defer src=/nana/js/copy-code.js></script></html>
