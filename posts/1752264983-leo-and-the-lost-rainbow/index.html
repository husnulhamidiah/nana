He loved to jump and roar loudly because he was happy.
Suddenly, Leo saw a bright rainbow in the sky.
It was colorful and shiny, and Leo wanted to catch it.
He jumped high but he missed.
The rainbow dipped lower and lower.
Then, Leo jumped again, and oh no!
He accidentally brushed the rainbow with his paw.
The rainbow wobbled, and then, it slipped out of the sky and fell silently into the woods.</p><p>Leo was sad.
He did not mean to lose the rainbow.
He ran to his friend Mia, a wise owl.
&lsquo;Mia, I lost the rainbow.
It’s gone!
What can I do?
&rsquo; he asked.
Mia looked at him kindly.
&lsquo;The rainbow is special.
Maybe it can be found again if we work together,&rsquo; she said.
So, Leo and Mia went into the woods to look for the lost rainbow.</p><p>They searched high and low among the trees and flowers.
Suddenly, Leo saw a little girl crying near a pond.
She looked very upset.
&lsquo;What is wrong?
&rsquo; Leo asked softly.
The girl, named Lily, said, &lsquo;My favorite toy boat is stuck in the mud, and I cannot reach it.
&rsquo; Leo thought for a moment.
Then he said, &lsquo;Maybe I can help you.
&rsquo; With Mia’s help, Leo carefully nudged the boat free.
Lily smiled happily and thanked Leo.</p><p>Leo realized that helping Lily made everyone feel better.
&lsquo;If I help one friend, I can also help find the rainbow,&rsquo; Leo said.
They kept searching, and soon, Mia found the rainbow tangled in a net of vines.
Leo nudged the vines gently, and the rainbow floated up slowly, shining brighter than ever.
Slowly, it zipped back into the sky, returning the bright colors everyone loved to see.</p><p>Leo felt proud and happy.
He learned that sharing kindness and helping friends can fix even the biggest problem.
From that day, Leo remembered to always be kind and helpful, just like when he returned the rainbow to the sky.</p></div><p class=single-summary>Helping others and sharing can turn problems into happy moments.</p></article><div class=single-pagination><hr><div class=flexnowrap><div class=single-pagination-prev><div class=single-pagination-container-prev><div class=single-pagination-text>←</div><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/nana/posts/1752264772-luna-the-little-owl-and-the-missing-big-branch/>Luna the Little Owl and the Missing Big Branch</a></div></div></div><div class=single-pagination-next></div></div><hr></div><div class=back-to-top><a href=#top>back to top</a></div></div></main></div><footer></footer></body><script src=/nana/js/theme-switch.js></script><script defer src=/nana/js/copy-code.js></script></html>
