He loved looking at the stars twinkle in the dark sky.
Suddenly, he saw something shiny fall past him.
It was a tiny star!
Ollie was surprised.
&lsquo;Oh, little star, where are you going?
&rsquo; he asked softly.</p><p>The star blinked and said, &lsquo;I was falling from the big sky, and now I am lost.
I want to go home, but I don’t know the way.
&rsquo; Ollie wanted to help.
&lsquo;Don’t worry,&rsquo; he said with a kind smile.
&lsquo;I will try to find out where your home is.</p><p>Ollie flew around the forest with the star on his back.
He asked the wise old owl, the chirping birds, and even the gentle rabbits.
But no one knew exactly where the stars belonged.
Ollie felt a little sad, but he remembered what his mother had said, &lsquo;Kindness always leads the way.</p><p>Finally, a gentle breeze whispered to Ollie.
&lsquo;Follow the moon,&rsquo; it said softly.
Ollie looked up and saw the bright moon shining.
&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; he said happily.
Guided by the moonlight, Ollie and the star traveled to the hilltop.
There, they saw the glowing sky full of stars, waiting to shine again.</p><p>As the stars floated back into the sky, the tiny star twinkled brightly.
&lsquo;Thank you, Ollie!
You are very kind,&rsquo; said the star.
Ollie smiled and nodded.
He closed his eyes and felt happy that he helped his new friend.</p><p>From that night, Ollie knew that helping others, no matter how small they are, makes the world feel much brighter.
Even the tiniest owl can do big things with kindness.</p></div><p class=single-summary>Helping others makes everyone shine brighter.</p></article><div class=single-pagination><hr><div class=flexnowrap><div class=single-pagination-prev><div class=single-pagination-container-prev><div class=single-pagination-text>←</div><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/nana/posts/1752259666-the-little-turtle-and-the-big-river/>The Little Turtle and the Big River</a></div></div></div><div class=single-pagination-next><div class=single-pagination-container-next><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/nana/posts/1752260635-the-little-rabbit-and-the-missing-carrot/>The Little Rabbit and the Missing Carrot</a></div><div class=single-pagination-text>→</div></div></div></div><hr></div><div class=back-to-top><a href=#top>back to top</a></div></div></main></div><footer></footer></body><script src=/nana/js/theme-switch.js></script><script defer src=/nana/js/copy-code.js></script></html>
