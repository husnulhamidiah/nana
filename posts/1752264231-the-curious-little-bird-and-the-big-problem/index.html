He looked around and saw that his nest was all broken.
&lsquo;Oh no!
&rsquo; Pip chirped.
&lsquo;My nest is all wonky!
I need to fix it.
&rsquo; He tried to fix the twigs himself, but they kept falling apart.</p><p>Pip saw his friend, Bella the bird.
&lsquo;Bella,&rsquo; Pip said sadly, &lsquo;my nest is broken.
What can I do?
&rsquo; Bella smiled kindly.
&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s ask the other birds for help,&rsquo; she suggested.
Pip was happy to ask because he knew many birds liked to help friends.</p><p>Soon, Pip called his friends.
Max the robin, Lily the swallow, and even Tom the wise old owl came to see the broken nest.
Together, they looked at the nest.
Max fluttered his wings.
&lsquo;We can gather stronger twigs!
&rsquo; he chirped.
Lily suggested, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s make the nest bigger so it stays sturdy.</p><p>The birds worked together quickly.
Max found long, strong twigs.
Lily carried soft feathers to make the nest cozy.
Tom helped by telling everyone how to tie the twigs tightly.
Pip cheered, &lsquo;We did it together!
Now I have a much better nest.</p><p>At the end of the day, Pip learned that asking friends for help makes fixing problems much easier.
He felt happy and proud that everyone worked as a team.
His new nest was even better than before, and he was glad he asked for help.</p></div><p class=single-summary>Working together makes problems easier to solve.</p></article><div class=single-pagination><hr><div class=flexnowrap><div class=single-pagination-prev><div class=single-pagination-container-prev><div class=single-pagination-text>←</div><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/nana/posts/1752263785-leo-the-little-lion-and-the-lost-hat/>Leo the Little Lion and the Lost Hat</a></div></div></div><div class=single-pagination-next><div class=single-pagination-container-next><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/nana/posts/1752264772-luna-the-little-owl-and-the-missing-big-branch/>Luna the Little Owl and the Missing Big Branch</a></div><div class=single-pagination-text>→</div></div></div></div><hr></div><div class=back-to-top><a href=#top>back to top</a></div></div></main></div><footer></footer></body><script src=/nana/js/theme-switch.js></script><script defer src=/nana/js/copy-code.js></script></html>
