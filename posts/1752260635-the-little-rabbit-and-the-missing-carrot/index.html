He felt hungry and thought about his favorite crunchy carrot.
But oh no!
When he looked around, his carrot was missing.
Benny wondered, “Where is my tasty carrot?”</p><p>Benny decided to ask his friend, Bella the squirrel.
“Bella, I lost my carrot.
Have you seen it?”
Bella looked around and said, “No, Benny.
I haven&rsquo;t seen it.
Let&rsquo;s look together!”
Benny felt a bit worried but decided to stay calm.</p><p>They started searching near the bushes and under the leaves.
“Maybe it rolled away,” said Bella.
“Let’s check the garden,” suggested Benny.
As they looked, they saw a trail of tiny bites nearby.
“Look!”
exclaimed Benny.
“It’s little holes made by the field mice!”</p><p>Benny and Bella followed the small holes and found the mice happily munching on the carrots.
“Sorry, Benny,” squeaked the mouse.
“We were very hungry and didn’t mean to take your favorite.”
Benny thought for a moment.
“It’s okay.
Thank you for telling me,” he said kindly.</p><p>Benny learned that sometimes, mistakes happen.
Instead of getting upset, talking calmly and working together helped everyone.
The mice promised to share more carrots next time, and Benny was happy to see his friends eating happily.</p><p>From that day on, Benny knew that asking kindly and being patient could solve problems faster than getting angry.
And everyone learned that sharing makes everyone smile more.</p></div><p class=single-summary>Helping friends and being patient can solve problems better than rushing.</p></article><div class=single-pagination><hr><div class=flexnowrap><div class=single-pagination-prev><div class=single-pagination-container-prev><div class=single-pagination-text>←</div><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/nana/posts/1752260543-the-little-red-owl-and-the-lost-stars/>The Little Red Owl and the Lost Stars</a></div></div></div><div class=single-pagination-next></div></div><hr></div><div class=back-to-top><a href=#top>back to top</a></div></div></main></div><footer></footer></body><script src=/nana/js/theme-switch.js></script><script defer src=/nana/js/copy-code.js></script></html>
