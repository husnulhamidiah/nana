Tim loved his pond, but one day he saw a big, wide river.
&lsquo;How will I cross it?
&rsquo; he asked himself.
The river was very deep and the water was fast.
Tim felt worried but also curious about what was on the other side.</p><p>Tim decided to ask his friends in the pond for help.
First, he asked the wise old frog.
&lsquo;Frog, how can I cross the river?
&rsquo; Frog thought for a moment and said, &lsquo;I can help you!
Let’s find some sticks and some leaves to build a small raft.</p><p>The animals worked together.
The ants carried tiny twigs, the beavers chewed big wood logs, and the birds brought leaves.
Tim watched carefully and learned how everyone helped each other.
Soon, they made a little boat that looked strong enough for Tim.</p><p>Tim was nervous but also excited.
&lsquo;Thank you, friends,&rsquo; he said.
&lsquo;I will try the boat now.
&rsquo; With help from his friends, Tim stepped onto the raft.
It wobbled a lot, but they all cheered him on.
Slowly, the raft floated onto the river.
Tim held on tight and looked at the water rushing below.</p><p>When the boat reached the other side, Tim was so happy.
He hugged his friends and said, &lsquo;I couldn’t have done it without you.
Your help made me brave.
&rsquo; Tim realized that working together and being patient could help him do brave things he was scared of at first.</p><p>From that day on, Tim knew that even a tiny turtle could cross big rivers with a little help and lots of kindness.
He was ready to explore new places, knowing friends are always near.</p></div><p class=single-summary>Helping friends and being patient can make big challenges easier to overcome.</p></article><div class=single-pagination><hr><div class=flexnowrap><div class=single-pagination-prev><div class=single-pagination-container-prev><div class=single-pagination-text>←</div><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/nana/posts/1752254641-the-little-turtle-and-the-busy-bird/>The Little Turtle and the Busy Bird</a></div></div></div><div class=single-pagination-next><div class=single-pagination-container-next><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/nana/posts/1752260543-the-little-red-owl-and-the-lost-stars/>The Little Red Owl and the Lost Stars</a></div><div class=single-pagination-text>→</div></div></div></div><hr></div><div class=back-to-top><a href=#top>back to top</a></div></div></main></div><footer></footer></body><script src=/nana/js/theme-switch.js></script><script defer src=/nana/js/copy-code.js></script></html>
