But oh no!
It was not there.
He looked everywhere in his little bunny house.
&lsquo;Where is my car?
&rsquo; Timmy asked himself, feeling a little sad.</p><p>His friend Sally the Sparrow saw him looking worried.
&lsquo;What happened, Timmy?
&rsquo; she chirped.
&lsquo;I lost my car.
I can’t find it anywhere,&rsquo; Timmy said sadly.
Sally thought for a moment.
&lsquo;Let’s look together!
Maybe we can find it.</p><p>Timmy nodded, feeling happier with Sally’s help.
They went outside, searching near the flowers, under the table, and behind the bushes.
But the car was not there.
Timmy was about to give up when Sally noticed something shiny near the pond.</p><p>‘Look!
Is that your car, Timmy?
’ Sally asked, pointing her wing.
Timmy ran over and saw his red car by the water’s edge.
‘Yes!
It’s mine!
’ he cheered.
He was so happy to find his special toy again.
He thanked Sally for her help.</p><p>Together, they played with the car, bouncing it under the sun.
Timmy learned that asking for help and working together made finding his toy easier.
From that day, he knew it’s okay to ask friends when you need help, and friends will always be there for you.</p></div><p class=single-summary>Always ask for help when you need it.
