She loved her warm mittens because they kept her hands cozy.
Suddenly, she saw a tiny snowflake land on her mitten.
It was tiny and shimmering, like a little star.
The snowflake said, “Please don’t melt me!
I want to stay here and be your friend.”</p><p>Lina looked at the snowflake and said, “But I don’t want you to melt, because then I will lose you.”
She felt sad for her new tiny friend.
Suddenly, her mom came close and said, “Lina, what are you talking to?”
Lina explained, “There’s a snowflake on my mitten, and it wants to stay cold so it doesn’t melt.”</p><p>Her mom smiled kindly and said, “Maybe we can help it stay cool.”
Lina thought for a moment.
She gently blew a little puff of cool air from her mouth onto the snowflake.
The snowflake shimmered brightly and stayed.
“Wow!
I think we did it!”
Lina cheered happily.
She knew that caring for the snowflake was a kind thing to do.</p><p>After a while, Lena’s mitten warmed up a bit as she played, and the snowflake started to melt.
Lina looked sad, but her mom said, “It’s okay.
Even small friends like this snowflake need to find their place.
Maybe it will become water and travel to the sky again.”
Lina nodded and whispered, “Goodbye, little snowflake.
Thank you for teaching me to care.”</p><p>Lina learned that helping others, even tiny snowflakes, can make a big difference.
She smiled because she knew her small act of kindness was special.
She looked up at the sky and wondered when she would meet another little friend to help.</p></div><p class=single-summary>Helping others, even small ones, can create wonderful surprises.</p></article><div class=single-pagination><hr><div class=flexnowrap><div class=single-pagination-prev><div class=single-pagination-container-prev><div class=single-pagination-text>←</div><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/nana/posts/1752262246-leo-the-little-lions-big-problem/>Leo the Little Lion’s Big Problem</a></div></div></div><div class=single-pagination-next><div class=single-pagination-container-next><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/nana/posts/1752263785-leo-the-little-lion-and-the-lost-hat/>Leo the Little Lion and the Lost Hat</a></div><div class=single-pagination-text>→</div></div></div></div><hr></div><div class=back-to-top><a href=#top>back to top</a></div></div></main></div><footer></footer></body><script src=/nana/js/theme-switch.js></script><script defer src=/nana/js/copy-code.js></script></html>
