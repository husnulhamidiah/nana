She loved her shiny feather that sparkled in the sunlight.
One day, while flying over the trees, Bella suddenly felt her feather loosen.
Before she knew it, her favorite feather floated down and landed softly on the ground.
&lsquo;Oh no!
&rsquo; Bella chirped.
She looked around and saw her shiny feather lying by a patch of grass.
But it was a little far from her branch.</p><p>Bella wanted her feather back.
She asked her squirrel friend, Sammy, &lsquo;Can you help me find my missing feather?
&rsquo; Sammy looked at the feather and said, &lsquo;I see it!
But it&rsquo;s a little hidden under some leaves.
&rsquo; They both looked carefully and gently moved the leaves.
Bella was so happy to see her feather again, but she was a little worried about flying without it.</p><p>Then, her wise old owl neighbor, Ollie, came by and saw her sad face.
He said, &lsquo;Sometimes, losing something makes us feel upset, but it&rsquo;s also an adventure.
You can still enjoy your day, even if your feather is not with you.
Remember, your smile is very special.
&rsquo; Bella listened and took a deep breath.
She realized she could still sing and fly happily, even without her shiny feather for a while.
She thanked Ollie and decided to keep the feather as a special keepsake.</p><p>From that day, Bella knew that losing something might make us sad at first, but it can also help us learn to be patient and brave.
She kept her feather safe and continued to enjoy her flying adventures, knowing that her true happiness was inside her, not just on her feathers.</p></div><p class=single-summary>It's important to be gentle and patient when we feel upset about losing something special.</p></article><div class=single-pagination><hr><div class=flexnowrap><div class=single-pagination-prev><div class=single-pagination-container-prev><div class=single-pagination-text>←</div><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/nana/posts/1752253463-leo-the-little-lions-big-bright-idea/>Leo the Little Lion's Big Bright Idea</a></div></div></div><div class=single-pagination-next><div class=single-pagination-container-next><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/nana/posts/1752254548-timmy-and-the-lost-toy/>Timmy and the Lost Toy</a></div><div class=single-pagination-text>→</div></div></div></div><hr></div><div class=back-to-top><a href=#top>back to top</a></div></div></main></div><footer></footer></body><script src=/nana/js/theme-switch.js></script><script defer src=/nana/js/copy-code.js></script></html>
