He loved to play with his friends, but today he felt shy.
When the other animals went to play hide-and-seek, Leo wanted to join, but his paws were cold with worry.
&lsquo;What if I can&rsquo;t find a good hiding spot?
&rsquo; he asked himself.
So he sat alone under a tall tree, watching others run and hide.</p><p>His friend Ellie the elephant saw Leo sitting alone.
She walked over and said, &lsquo;Leo, why are you not playing?
Everyone wants you to join!
&rsquo; Leo looked at his feet and said, &lsquo;I am shy.
What if I can&rsquo;t find a good hiding spot?
&rsquo; Ellie smiled kindly.
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s okay to feel shy,&rsquo; she said.
&lsquo;But if you just try, you might find that playing is fun after all.</p><p>Leo looked at Ellie and thought.
Slowly, he took a deep breath.
&lsquo;Okay, I will try,&rsquo; he said quietly.
Leo decided to hide behind a big bush.
He closed his eyes for a moment, feeling a little scared but brave too.
When the game started, Leo tried his best to hide quietly behind the bush.
Soon, his friends found him and cheered, &lsquo;There you are, Leo!
&rsquo; Leo felt happy and proud that he had tried.</p><p>After the game, Leo ran to Ellie and said, &lsquo;Thank you for helping me be brave.
&rsquo; Ellie smiled.
&lsquo;You did a great job!
The brave thing is to try even when you&rsquo;re scared.
&rsquo; From that day, Leo played more happily, knowing that trying is the first step to fun and friendship.</p><p>Leo learned that everyone feels shy sometimes, but asking for help and trying your best can turn shyness into happiness.
Now he joins his friends with a big brave smile, ready for new adventures.</p></div><p class=single-summary>Being brave means trying even if you're a little scared.
