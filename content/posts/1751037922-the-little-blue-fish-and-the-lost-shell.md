One sunny morning, a little blue fish named Lila swam happily through the clear ocean. She loved her shiny shell, which she wore around her neck. But one day, she looked down and noticed that her shell was missing. 'Oh no!' she said, 'Where is my shell?'

Lila swam around in circles, looking for her shell. She asked a crab, 'Have you seen my shiny shell?' The crab shrugged, 'No, I haven’t.' Lila asked a starfish, 'Did you see my shell?' The starfish said, 'I’m not sure.' Lila was feeling sad. 'What will I do without my shell?' she wondered.

Just then, a friendly sea turtle passed by. 'What’s wrong, Lila?' asked the turtle. Lila said, 'I can’t find my shell, and I’ve looked everywhere!' The turtle smiled and pointed with his flipper. 'Look right under you,' he said.

Lila looked down and, to her surprise, her shiny shell was resting on a rock right beneath her. 'Oh, thank you, Turtle!' Lila exclaimed, feeling so happy. From then on, she was extra careful with her shell, and whenever she lost something, she knew she could always ask for help.
