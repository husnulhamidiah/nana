Luna loved her bright red hat.
 It was soft and warm, perfect for sunny days and breezy mornings.
 One day, she wore it to the park.
 She played on the swings and ran around happily.

After playing, Luna looked for her hat to go home.
 She looked under the slide, by the bench, and in the bushes.
 But her hat was gone!
 Luna felt sad.
 ‘Oh no!
 Where is my hat?
’ she whispered.

Just then, a tiny squirrel named Sammy saw Luna looking sad.
 'Are you looking for something?
' Sammy asked.
 Luna nodded.
 ‘Yes, my hat.
 I can’t find it.
’ Sammy squeaked happily, ‘I saw a red thing near the tall tree, but I didn’t touch it.

Luna followed Sammy to the tall tree.
 There, under some leaves, she saw her bright red hat.
 Someone had left it there!
 Luna was happy.
 ‘Thank you, Sammy!
 You found my hat!
’ she said.
 Sammy smiled.
 ‘I’m glad I could help.

Luna picked up her hat carefully.
 She shared her gratitude with Sammy.
 ‘Thank you for your help.
 Here, I will share my cookie with you,’ she said, offering him a piece.
 Sammy giggled and ate it happily.

That day, Luna learned that friends helping each other can make a small problem into a happy story.
 She put her hat gently on her head and promised to always share and be kind.
 From then on, she and Sammy played together happily in the park.

Luna’s hat was special, not just because it was bright red, but because it reminded her that kind friends make everything better.
 And that made her smile all the way home.
