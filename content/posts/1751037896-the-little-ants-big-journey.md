Once upon a time, in a busy garden, lived a little ant named Tilly. She was very small, but she had big dreams. Every day, she watched the bigger ants carry food and help the queen. 'I wish I could do something important too!' Tilly sighed.

One day, a big rainstorm flooded the garden. The water started to rise, and all the ants were scared. 'We need to find a way to save our food!' shouted one of the ants. But the flood was too big for the older ants to handle.

Tilly felt nervous but decided she had to do something. She had an idea! 'I will bring the food to the big hill!' she said. The hill was high, and the ants could place food there to keep it safe from the water. But the path was long and tricky for a tiny ant like Tilly.

With her little legs moving fast, Tilly carried food piece by piece, dodging puddles and climbing over small rocks. The other ants watched her and cheered, 'Go Tilly! You can do it!' After a long time, Tilly finally reached the hill. She smiled proudly. 'I did it! I helped the whole garden!'

The rain stopped, and the ants were safe. The queen said, 'Tilly, you may be small, but you have a big heart. You saved us all!' Tilly beamed with happiness. She knew that sometimes, being small didn’t mean you couldn’t do big things.
