Leo the lion was very small, but he loved to dream.
 One sunny morning, he saw his friends playing loudly in the jungle.
 They were having so much fun, but Leo wished he could help them play even better.

He thought for a moment and said, “What if I find a way to make our games more fun?”
 His friends looked at him with big eyes.
 “What can you do, Leo?”
 asked Tika the turtle.
 Leo smiled shyly and said, “I will think of something!”

That afternoon, Leo watched the leaves and bugs around the jungle.
 Suddenly, an idea came into his mind.
 He ran to his friends saying, “I found something!
 We can use big leaves as sails to make our digging carts go faster!”

His friends thought that was a funny idea, but they decided to try it.
 They tied big leaves to their carts and pushed them down the hill.
 Whoosh!
 The carts zoomed faster than before.
 Everyone cheered!
 Even Leo’s small idea made their game super fun.

From that day, Leo learned that sometimes small ideas can make a big difference.
 No matter how tiny you are, your thoughts can help everyone have more fun and be happier.
