 'How will I cross it?
' he asked himself.
 The river was very deep and the water was fast.
 Tim felt worried but also curious about what was on the other side.

Tim decided to ask his friends in the pond for help.
 First, he asked the wise old frog.
 'Frog, how can I cross the river?
' Frog thought for a moment and said, 'I can help you!
 Let’s find some sticks and some leaves to build a small raft.

The animals worked together.
 The ants carried tiny twigs, the beavers chewed big wood logs, and the birds brought leaves.
 Tim watched carefully and learned how everyone helped each other.
 Soon, they made a little boat that looked strong enough for Tim.

Tim was nervous but also excited.
 'Thank you, friends,' he said.
 'I will try the boat now.
' With help from his friends, Tim stepped onto the raft.
 It wobbled a lot, but they all cheered him on.
 Slowly, the raft floated onto the river.
 Tim held on tight and looked at the water rushing below.

When the boat reached the other side, Tim was so happy.
 He hugged his friends and said, 'I couldn’t have done it without you.
 Your help made me brave.
' Tim realized that working together and being patient could help him do brave things he was scared of at first.
