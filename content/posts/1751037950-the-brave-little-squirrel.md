Once upon a time, in a big green forest, lived a little squirrel named Sammy. Sammy was very small, but he had a big heart. He loved to play with his friends, the rabbits and birds.

One sunny day, Sammy's friend Bella, the rabbit, called out, 'Help! I lost my favorite carrot!' Sammy said, 'Don't worry, Bella! I will help you find it!'

Sammy looked everywhere. He climbed trees and sniffed bushes, but he could not find the carrot. Bella looked sad. 'I wish I could find it too,' she sighed.

'Maybe I can ask Mr. Owl,' said Sammy. He ran to find Mr. Owl, who was wise and very big. 'Mr. Owl! Can you help us find Bella's carrot?' Sammy squeaked.

Mr. Owl thought for a moment and said, 'I saw a shiny orange thing near the big old tree. It might be the carrot!' Sammy's eyes sparkled. 'Thank you, Mr. Owl!' he chirped.

Sammy quickly ran to the big old tree. 'Bella! I think I found it!' he cried. Under the tree, there it was—the shiny carrot! Bella jumped with joy. 'You did it, Sammy! You’re so brave!'
